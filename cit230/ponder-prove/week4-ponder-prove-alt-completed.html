<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> Molly Smith had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <acronym title="Nature, New Scientist">NNS</acronym> and all the other  <dfn>scientific</dfn> journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's <s>favourite</s> book since college, and the longer she spent in these <i>four walls</i> the more she felt she needed to be <strong>free.</strong></p>
<p>She had spent the last <b>ten</b> years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.</q> Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
