        <h1>Syllabus</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>CSE 110 is designed to be a first introduction to programming. In it, you will learn the basic building blocks of programming and how to use them to accomplish meaningful tasks. After taking this course, you'll be prepared to use programming in your own areas of interest and to learn more about programming in future courses.</p>

        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <p>Successful graduates for CSE 110 will:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>be able to use programming building blocks (variables, conditionals, loops, files) to accomplish meaningful tasks in a variety of domains.</p></li>
            <li><p>have confidence that they can be successful in programming and in learning more about it.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Materials</h2>
        <p>There is no textbook for this course. Instead, you will be provided links to videos and web pages containing the preparation material you will need.</p>

        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>This course will use Python 3 for programming and the materials will recommend the use of Visual Studio Code.</p>
        <p>These applications are free and available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. You are expected to have a laptop that can run these programs.</p>

        <p>You will use Slack for communication about the course and I-Learn to submit assignments and quizzes.</p>

        <h2>Organization</h2>
        <p>This course is organized into a series of lessons. In the semester version of the course, you will complete one lesson each week. In the block version of the course, you will complete two lessons each week.</p>

        <p>Each lesson is organized as follows:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p><heading>Prepare: Preparation Material</heading>&mdash;Links will be provided to videos and reading material that should be completed individually prior to moving on to the rest of the lesson.</p></li>
            <li><p><heading>Prepare: Checkpoint</heading>&mdash;A small individual programming assignment designed to help you practice the mechanics of the reading.</p></li>
            <li><p><heading>Teach: Team Activity</heading>&mdash;A 1-hour programming activity to be completed with 3&ndash;5 other students. Face-to-face students will complete this activity during class. Online students will arrange a synchronous video conference.</p></li>
            <li><p><heading>Prove: Programming Assignment</heading>&mdash;A large individual programming project. Many of these span two lessons, with a milestone deliverable coming due at the end of the first lesson.</p></li>
            <li><p><heading>Ponder: Check your understanding</heading>&mdash;Every other lesson will have a multiple-choice quiz to help you check your understanding of the topic.</p></li>
            <li><p><heading>Ponder: Reflection</heading>&mdash;Every other week will contain 2&ndash;3 short response questions to allow you to reflect on the things you are learning.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>The grading breakdown for the course is the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>15%&mdash;Checkpoints</p></li>
            <li><p>15%&mdash;Team Activities</p></li>
            <li><p>55%&mdash;Assignments</p></li>
            <li><p>10%&mdash;Check Your Understanding</p></li>
            <li><p>5%&mdash;Reflections</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Assignments will be generally graded in broad categories according to the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>0%&mdash;Nothing submitted.</p></li>
            <li><p>50%&mdash;Some attempt made.</p></li>
            <li><p>75%&mdash;Developing (but significantly deficient).</p></li>
            <li><p>85%&mdash;Slightly deficient.</p></li>
            <li><p>93%&mdash;Meets requirements.</p></li>
            <li><p>100%&mdash;Made it your own. This will be explained in the individual assignments, but there is an expectation to show creativity and extend your assignments beyond the minimum standard that is specifically required.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Letter grades will be awarded as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>93&ndash;100% = A</p></li>
            <li><p>90&ndash;92.9% = A-</p></li>
            <li><p>87&ndash;89.9% = B+</p></li>
            <li><p>83&ndash;86.9% = B</p></li>
            <li><p>80&ndash;82.9% = B-</p></li>
            <li><p>77&ndash;79.9% = C+</p></li>
            <li><p>73&ndash;76.9% = C</p></li>
            <li><p>70&ndash;72.9% = C-</p></li>

            <li><p>0&ndash;59.9% = F</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>All grades are reported in I-Learn.</p>

        <h2>Late work</h2>
        <p>For late checkpoints, team activities, and quizzes, there is a 10% penalty for each day that has passed since the due date, up to a maximum of 50% penalty for any given assignment.</p>
        <p>The larger programming assignments are not accepted late. Instead, you should submit what you have completed by the due date for partial credit.</p>
        <p>Extenuating circumstances should be discussed with the instructor prior to the assignment due date.</p>

        <h2>Honor Code</h2>
        <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
        <p>You are expected to follow <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/academic-honesty" target="_blank">the university's policies for academic honesty</a>.</p>

        <p>You may work with your classmates but all submitted work for projects and assignments must be original. Share ideas; do not share code! Assistance from a classmate should be on par with the help you would expect from a lab assistant.</p>

        <p>If you work closely with another student, helping teach and learn from each other, make sure you each still write your own code, but in this case, your solutions may end up being very similar. This is completely fine, but please make sure to put a comment in your code stating that you wrote your own program, but worked closely with that person, and that is why it is similar.</p>
        
        <p>You are encouraged to use the Internet as a resource, but recognize that you should not copy and paste someone elseâ€™s work as your own. Cite all sources and follow copyright laws. <strong>When in doubt, give credit and be upfront</strong>.</p>

        <p>Do not look for or share solutions on "note sharing" internet sites.</p>
        
        <p>The penalty for copying or plagiarism of assignments might be one or more of the following: -100% on an assignment, being asked to withdraw from the class, a failing grade in the class, or disciplinary action by the University.</p>

        <h3>Dress and Grooming</h3>
        <p>You are expected to follow the university's <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/dress-and-grooming" target="_blank">Dress and Grooming Standards</a></p>

        <h2>Grievance Policy</h2>
        <p>Review the <a href="http://www.byui.edu/catalog/#/policy/SJ8pMAmZr?bc=true&bcCurrent=Student%20Grievance&bcGroup=Academic%20Grievance%20Policy&bcItemType=policies">Academic Student Grievance Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>Student Support</h2>
        <p>Support is available in many ways including via other class members and discussion in Slack. In addition, help is available through the university's <a href="http://www.byui.edu/academic-support-centers"> academic support center</a>.</p>

        <h2>Sexual Harassment</h2>
        <p>BYU-Idaho is committed to promoting and maintaining a safe and respectful environment for the campus community. Sexual misconduct is against the law, contrary to the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Honor Code, and inconsistent with the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, which we hope are embodied on our campus. The university prohibits sexual misconduct perpetrated by or against university students, university employees, participants in university programs, or visitors to its campus, whether the behavior occurs on or off campus.</p>
