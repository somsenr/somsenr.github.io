        <h1>Syllabus</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>CSE 110 is designed to be a first introduction to programming. In it, you will learn the basic building blocks of programming and how to use them to accomplish meaningful tasks. After taking this course, you'll be prepared to use programming in your own areas of interest and to learn more about programming in future courses.</p>

        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <p>Successful graduates for CSE 110 will:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>be able to use programming building blocks (variables, conditionals, loops, files) to accomplish meaningful tasks</p></li>
            <li><p>appreciate the value of programming</p></li>
            <li><p>have confidence that they can be successful in programming and in learning more about it</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Materials</h2>
        <p>There is no textbook for this course. Instead, you will be provided links to videos and webpages containing the preparation material you will need.</p>

        <h2>Attendance</h2>
        <p>
          Students are expected to attend class, participate, and are allowed one unexcused absence for each credit offered. Thereafter, a student's grade may be reduced. In the event of an absence, students are responsible for any missed information from class and will need to get notes, assignments, etc. from a fellow student or the instructor. Excused absences (representing the college officially) will not reflect on the records of the student.</p>
            
        <p>  A roll chart will be distributed early in the semester and attendance will be taken during each class. Students are responsible to sign the roll chart as it passes by them. If the student is not in the class when attendance is taken, the student will be marked absent. It is the student’s responsibility to inform the instructor that he or she came in late or left early so that an absence can be changed to a tardy. If a student does not talk with the instructor that day, an absence will remain on the student’s records.</p>
            
        <p>
            We will be starting each class with a 3-minute mini-devotional whereby students are asked to be prepared and when called on to:</p>
     
       <ul>
          <li>Introduce him/herself</li>
           <li>Share a spiritual thought</li>
           <li>Offer a prayer</li>
          
          </ul>   
        
        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>This course will use Python 3 for programming and the materials will recommend the use of Visual Studio Code.</p>
        <p>These applications are free and available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. You are expected to have a laptop that can run these programs.</p>

        <p>You will use Slack for communication about the course and I-Learn to submit assignments and quizzes.</p>

        <h2>Organization</h2>
        <p>This course is organized into a series of lessons. In the semester version of the course, you will complete one lesson each week. In the block version of the course, you will complete two lessons each week.</p>

        <p>Each lesson is organized as follows:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p><heading>Prepare: Preparation Material</heading> - Links will be provided to videos and reading material that should be completed individually prior to moving on to the rest of the lesson.</p></li>
            <li><p><heading>Prepare: Checkpoint</heading> - A small individual programming assignment designed to help you practice the mechanics of the reading.</p></li>
            <li><p><heading>Teach: Team Activity</heading> - A 1-hour programming activity to be completed with 3-5 other students. Face-to-face students will complete this activity during class. Online students will arrange a synchronous video conference.</p></li>
            <li><p><heading>Prove: Programming Assignment</heading> - A large individual programming project. Many of these span two lessons, with a milestone deliverable coming due at the end of the first lesson.</p></li>
            <li><p><heading>Ponder: Check your understanding</heading> - Every other lesson will have a multiple-choice quiz to help you check your understanding of the topic.</p></li>
            <li><p><heading>Ponder: Reflection</heading> - Every other week will contain a 2-3 question short response to allow you to reflect on the things you are learning.</p></li>
        </ul>

         <h2>Homework</h2>
        <p>
          There will be weekly assignments due over the course of the semester.
          Many of these exercises build off of each other. It is important that
          you do not fall behind. Pay attention to Ilearn for the specific dates
          and times. There are three important dates associated to each activity
          or assignment:&nbsp;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The start date: The date the activity begins</li>
          <li>The due date: The date the activity is due.</li>
          <li>
            The end date: The date the activity locks and no submission will be
            allowed after that.
          </li>
        </ul>
          
          <p>Students must complete a thorough examination and execution of the assignments from their web site for that is where the web pages will be graded. The instructor will only correct homework assignments one time and students are not allowed to resubmit assignment for re-correction.</p>
        
        <p>A student will only recieve credit for an assignment if he/she: 
            <ul>
                <li>completes and submits an assignment for correction</li>
                <li>the link to the assignment works and the instructor is  able to retrieve the homework </li>
                <li> submits by the due date </li>
                
          </ul>
            
        <p> Exception for late homework: if a student does not have a note from an authority (submitted to the instructor within one day after the homework assignment's due date) and/or pre-approval from the instructor, the student will not receive credit. Take note that it is more important to have some portion of the assignment ready than not to have anything at all. </p>

         <p>Students are given one free-pass during the semester which means that he/she can submit/resubmit an assignment that has been given deficient points after he/she has corrected or fixed the assignment. In order to receive more points, the student needs to email the instructor asking to have the particular assignment re corrected. This one free-pass can not be used for the Final Website and Report.</p>
          
          <p>Students who do not agree with a grade may discuss it with the instructor within one week past the posting of the grade in ILearn. Please do not put the wdd130 links and respective week's homework documents up to the Canvas again because this may invalidate your claim for a higher grade.The instructor will ask the student to show proof (by doing a prtscreen) of the date the wdd130-links.html and respective homework documents were put to the host to ensure the documents do not have a date newer than the due date.</p>

       
        
        <p>
          *Please note:&nbsp; Activities are not accepted via email.&nbsp; You
          must submit your activities in the correct place and within the posted
          timeframe.
        </p>

        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>The grading breakdown for the course is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>15% - Checkpoints</p></li>
            <li><p>15% - Team Activities</p></li>
            <li><p>55% - Assignments</p></li>
            <li><p>10% - Check Your Understanding</p></li>
            <li><p>5% - Reflections</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Assignments will be generally graded in broad categories according to the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>0% - Nothing submitted</p></li>
            <li><p>50% - Some attempt made</p></li>
            <li><p>75% - Developing (but significantly deficient)</p></li>
            <li><p>85% - Slightly deficient</p></li>
            <li><p>93% - Meets requirements</p></li>
            <li><p>100% - Made it your own. This will be explained in the individual assignments, but there is an expectation to show creativity and extend your assignments beyond the minimum standard that is specifically required.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Letter grades will be awarded as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>90-100% - A</p></li>
            <li><p>80-89.9% - B</p></li>
            <li><p>70-79.9% - C</p></li>
            <li><p>60-69.9% - D</p></li>
            <li><p>0-59.9% - F</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>There will also be the usual +'s and -'s. All grades are reported in I-Learn.</p>

        <h2>Late work</h2>
        <p>For late checkpoints, team activities, and quizzes, there is a 10% penalty for each day that has passed since the due date, up to a maximum of 50% penalty for any given assignment.</p>
        <p>The larger programming assignments are not accepted late. Instead, you should submit what you have completed by the due date for partial credit.</p>
        <p>Extenuating circumstances should be discussed with the instructor prior to the assignment due date.</p>

        <h2>Honor Code</h2>
        <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
        <p>You are expected to follow <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/academic-honesty" target="_blank">the university's policies for academic honesty</a>.</p>

        <p>You may work with your classmates but all submitted work for projects and assignments must be original. Share ideas; do not share code! Assistance from a classmate should be on par with the help you would expect from a lab assistant.</p>

        <p>If you work closely with another student, helping teach and learn from each other, make sure you each still write your own code, but in this case, your solutions may end up being very similar. This is completely fine, but please make sure to put a comment in your code stating that you wrote your own program, but worked closely with that person, and that is why it is similar.</p>
        
        <p>You are encouraged to use the Internet as a resource, but recognize that you should not copy and paste someone else’s work as your own. Cite all sources and follow copyright laws. <strong>When in doubt, give credit and be upfront</strong>.</p>

        <p>Do not look for or share solutions on "note sharing" internet sites.</p>
        
        <p>The penalty for copying or plagiarism of assignments might be one or more of the following: -100% on an assignment, being asked to withdraw from the class, a failing grade in the class, or disciplinary action by the University.</p>

        <h3>Dress and Grooming</h3>
        <p>You are expected to follow the university's <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/dress-and-grooming" target="_blank">Dress and Grooming Standards</a></p>

        <h2>Grievance Policy</h2>
